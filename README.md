# Potion Effects
Display your active potion effects from a glance! **Powered by [OneConfig](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfig)**.

***

## Main Features

- Unlike most potion effects mods, this potion effects mod allows you to customize effects on a global *and* individual basis.
  - You can also only override certain options to be on an individual basis instead of all.

- This version of Potion Effects allows you to fine tune when a potion effect should show such as limiting allowed duration times

- This mod also includes standard potion effects options that you may see in other mods such as:
  - The ability to change the color of the name and duration text
  - Make the effects blink when the duration is low
  - Make only certain components appear
  - Change how the amplifiers are shown
  - Format how the individual text looks

More customization options can be found when using the mod!

## Credits
I originally made improvements from the original Potion Effects mod in [CheatBreaker](https://cheatbreaker.net). Most options such as excluding options have been ported to this. However, CheatBreaker nor myself are the original creators of this mod hence why the following are listed below:

- Mojang themselves actually display Potion Effects in your inventory
- [bsprks and jadedcat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/statuseffecthud) for making the original StatusEffectsHUD mod, allowing you to see effects active outside of your inventory.
- [powns](https://www.youtube.com/c/pownsdev) for originally making a potion effects mod that allowed individual potion effects customization and allowing name formatting
