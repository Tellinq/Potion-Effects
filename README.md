# Potion Effects
Display your active potion effects from a glance! **Powered by [OneConfig](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfig)**.

### Where are the releases?
The latest version of Potion Effects requires OneConfig Pre-release. This is so recursive options will be visible in the GUI. You can, however, go back to normal releases when finished editing.

Once recursive options are available in the release build, I will add Potion Effects to the Releases tab. If you want to try it early, go to the Actions page and download the latest artifacts.

**You will need to log in to GitHub to download Actions artifacts.**

## Main Features

- Unlike most potion effects mods, this potion effects mod allows you to customize effects on a global *and* individual basis.
  - You can also only override certain options to be on an individual basis instead of all.

- This version of Potion Effects allows you to fine tune when a potion effect should show such as limiting allowed duration times

- This mod also includes standard potion effects options that you may see in other mods such as:
  - The ability to change the color of the name and duration text
  - Make the effects blink when the duration is low
  - Make only certain components appear
  - Change how the amplifiers are shown
  - Format how the individual text looks

More customization options can be found when using the mod!

## Credits
I originally made improvements from the original Potion Effects mod in [CheatBreaker 2](https://cheatbreaker2.com). Most options such as excluding options have been ported to this. However, CheatBreaker 2 nor myself are the original creators of this mod hence why the following are listed below:

- Mojang themselves actually display Potion Effects in your inventory
- [bsprks and jadedcat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/statuseffecthud) for making the original StatusEffectsHUD mod, allowing you to see effects active outside of your inventory.
- [powns](https://www.youtube.com/c/pownsdev) for originally making a potion effects mod that allowed individual potion effects customization and allowing name formatting
